# m6502

MOS Technology 6502 series processor.

Compatible with:
- 6502
- 6510
- 8502

## Development Notes

### Program Counter
The program counter on the 6502 increments *before* fetching the opcode, not after. To run code starting at address $400, the PC needs to be set to $3ff. This kept confusing me when switching between this processor and the Z80 which does not have this behavior. The solution is to obtain the address of the next instruction using `cpu.PC() + cpu.Offset()`. On the Z80, Offset returns 0 but on the 6502 returns 1.

### BRK/PHP/PLP instructions
All these years I thought there was a [break flag](https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Status_flags#The_B_flag) on the processor but apparently that is not true. The only time this is "seen" is during a `brk` instruction. When the status register is pushed to the stack in this case, bit 4, the so-called break flag, is set. I implemented the `brk` instruction wrong at least twice. The correct implementation, after decoding the opcode, appears to be:

* fetch another byte which is discarded
* push the value of the PC + 1 to the stack
* push the value of the status register with bit 5 set.
* disable interrupts
* set the PC to the value found at 0xfffe - 1

When pushing the status register to the stack using the `php` instruction, ensure that both bits 4 and 5 are set. The `plp` instruction needs to make sure that bit 4, if set, is cleared when it is transfered to the status register.

In this implementation the status register is a variable. In other implementaitons I made it a getter and setter function. To ensure bit 5 is always set and that bit 4 is always clear, those operations are applied after each instruction is executed.

```go
c.push(c.SR | FlagB | Flag5)
```

### TXS/TSX Instructions
- `tsx` modifies the N and Z flags.
- `txs` does not modify any flags.

The reference I was using did not mention anything about the flags for these operations.

### Testing
Unit tests were written when the 6502 emulator was developed to try and catch as many cases as possible but it has gaps in coverage. This provides a good quick first test to make sure the code is running as expected.

For full coverage, the tests written by Klaus Dormann from the [6502_65C02_functional_tests repository](6502_65C02_functional_tests) are used.
The assembly code for running these tests are not found in the repository. Download `bin_files/6502_functional_test.bin` and place it in a `~/rcs/ext/m6502` directory. Run the tests by using the build tag `ext`.
