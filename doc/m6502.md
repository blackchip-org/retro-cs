# m6502

MOS Technology 6502 series processor.

Compatible with:
- 6502
- 6510
- 8502

## Development Notes

### Instructions and addressing modes
Addressing modes are implemented as functions and instructions then take these functions as arguments. For example, the instruction `ldy $1234` is defined as:

```go
func(c *CPU) { ld(c, c.storeY, c.loadAbsolute) }
```

All load operations use the same `ld()` function and the arguments are changed for each addressing mode. There is a special function, `storeBack`, that writes the value to the previously read memory location.

### Program Counter
The program counter on the 6502 increments *before* fetching the opcode, not after. To start running code at address $400, set the PC to $3ff. To generically get the address where the next instruction resides, use `cpu.PC() + cpu.Offset()`.

### BRK/PHP instructions
All these years I thought there was a [break flag](https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Status_flags#The_B_flag) on the processor but apparently that is not true. The only time this is "seen" is during a `brk` instruction. When the status register is pushed to the stack in this case, bit 4, the so-called break flag, is set. I confused myself over the `brk` instruction at least twice. The correct implementation, after decoding the opcode, appears to be:

* fetch another byte which is discarded
* push the value of the PC + 1 to the stack
* push the value of the status register with bit 5 set.
* disable interrupts
* set the PC to the value found at 0xfffe - 1

When pushing the status register to the stack using the `php` instruction, ensure that both bits 4 and 5 are set.

```go
c.push(c.SR | FlagB | Flag5)
```

### TXS/TSX Instructions

- `tsx` modifies the N and Z flags.
- `txs` does not modify any flags.

### Testing
Unit tests were written when the 6502 emulator was developed to try and catch as many cases as possible but it has gaps in coverage. This provides a good quick first test to make sure the code is running as expected.

For full coverage, the tests written by Klaus Dormann from the [6502_65C02_functional_tests repository](6502_65C02_functional_tests) are used.
The assembly code for running these tests are not found in the repository. Download `bin_files/6502_functional_test.bin` and place it in a `~/rcs/ext/m6502` directory. Run the tests by using the build tag `ext`.
