## Development Notes
These are my notes from the development work on the C64 emulator. I hope that these notes are useful for those who wish to write their own emulator.

### Memory
I have some thoughts on [memory](memory.md).

The Commodore 64 uses a [banked memory scheme](https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/Bank_Switching) and I implemented that from the beginning but completely forgot to wire it up. It actually isn't that important until much later on.

I assumed that writes to a region of memory that had ROM banked in were ignored. This is not correct. Writes will go to the RAM that is being hidden underneath the ROM. I haven't encountered this so far with the Commodore 64, but I did see it in the initialization routine for the Commodore 128. The code looks similar to this:

```
lda $e000,x
sta $e000,x
```

It does this to copy certain kernal routines that need to be available even if the ROM is banked out. It looks strange to see a load/store operation to the same address but it makes sense once you know what is going on.

### CPU
See the notes on the [6502](m6502.md) series processor.

The Commodore 64 actually has a 6510 processor but the differences between the two have no impact on this software implementation.

### First Light
The main loop started out endlessly executing CPU instructions. I loaded in the ROMs, started up the emulator, and took a look at what was in video RAM:

```
$0400  20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20  20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20
$0410  20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20  20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20
$0420  20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20  20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20
...

Cleared out with blank spaces, but no text. The emulator was stuck in a loop at this location:

```
$ff5e:  ad 12 d0  lda $d012
$ff61:  d0 fb     bne $ff5e
```

This register value contains the current raster scan line and the code is waiting for this value to go to zero. Since nothing was implemented yet to change this value, I added code to the main loop to stuff this value with zero on each iteration. Restarting the emulator got the desired result:

```
$0400  20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20  20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20
$0410  20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20  20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20

$04f0  20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20  20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20
```

Except for the first time when the system reported that 0 bytes were free. That was a bug in the `sdc` implementation.

### Video
Tile sheet from the `chargen` ROM:

![C64 chargen](img/c64-chargen.png)

For implementing text mode:

- Draw the border
- Draw the background
- Draw the characters

The characters are drawn to the texture by copying from the tile sheet and setting a color modification. 

Timing now became sort of important. The simple strategy used in Pac-Man of running 20,000 CPU instructions between VBLANKs worked here too. I put in the interrupt requests at this point too but I kept commenting it out since I was having problems. It would have been better to worry about them later as it is possible to get to a cursor-less READY prompt without them. Once I had the interrupts fixed, the emulator booted up properly.

### Keyboard
I first checked to see if I could directly insert key presses to the keyboard buffer at $c6 and update the buffer counter in $277. That worked so I went for that method to start. I just mapped the "simple" characters for now to be able to type. The fancy symbols and color directives can come later. 

I then typed in the following program to see if it worked:
```basic
10 PRINT "HELLO WORLD"
20 GOTO 10
RUN
```

It did, but I forgot to map the STOP key so I wasn't able to stop the loop. I then botched the stop key by mapping it to Control-C but didn't handle the key release properly. I was confused for a bit when the program would run the first time but then would immediately say "BREAK" when trying to run it again. 

### PRG load
Now I went looking for a nice simple BASIC program that I could load in for testing. I came across a game that I remembered from my youth called Monopole. It is a two player game of Monopoly with no AI. You have to actually have another person around to play. 

I loaded it up and it crashed right away. There are some pointers in zero page memory that need to be updated after a BASIC program is loaded. They are the pointer to variable storage at $2d and the pointer to array storage at $2f. They needed to be updated to the first byte after the program and then everything worked as expected.
